This repository contains sample programs demonstrating the scalability of a program with respect to the number of processors and cores in a hardware.

We use the libraries openmp (http://openmp.org/wp/) and TBB (https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) for this.

The initial set of programs are picked up from the course http://tinyurl.com/intro-to-openmp-tim-mattson .
